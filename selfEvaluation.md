# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - I feel fairly confident in my understanding with the general concepts of for statements. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - There was a lot of outside research being done and self-teaching which sometimes felt daunting. The struggle was productive in that I kept pushing through. There were moments of unproductive struggle when I lost focus and should've taken a break instead. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I still need to practice writing for statements with decrementing final expressions as well as filtering an array using for statements. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - What are the major uses of for statements in real life? And are there certain methods that are used more often than others?
